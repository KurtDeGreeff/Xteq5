**TestUtilSolution Readme**
   
  - Before releasing a new version for users, use Build -> Batch Build to create all files. 
    
	Note: TestUtilLauncher.exe will ALWAYS build for *Any CPU* only. This is on purpose. 

  - After that, run Inno Setup from src\Setup to generate "TestUtilSetup.exe".

  - The resulting file then needs to be tested 
   
  - If the file is OK, go to https://github.com/texhex/testutil/releases/new and attach it
     - First field is just the version number
     - Second field is what the user sees, so it's "Version X.yy")
